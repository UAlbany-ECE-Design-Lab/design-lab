## Ordering Parts

### Purchasing Options: 
Talk with the capstone instructor and project stakeholder regarding project budget and how parts should be ordered. There are two primary options.  

* **Direct from Sponsor:** If your stakeholder prefers to order the parts, please work with them directly. 
* **Department Purchased:** Some stakeholders prefer that the ECE department orders the parts. In this case, follow the instructions below.

Always make sure to keep an updated Bill of Materials (BOM) and track purchases on your team's GitHub repository. 

**Department Ordered Parts**
* Include a breakdown of the parts requested, filling out the spreadsheet available here ().  Check the vendor considerations below. 
* Check shipping costs, estimated delivery dates, and ensure parts are in-stock.
* Send an email to your stakeholder, faculty mentor, capstone instructors, and TA 
* Obtain approval from your stakeholder approval
* Obtain capstone instructor approval
* Once approved, the TA will work on getting the parts ordered and notify you when they have arrived.  

**Vendor Considerations**
* When possible, aggegrate purchases to from specific vendors.  This reduces shipping cost and simplifies ordering.  
* We are a non-profit institution and sales tax exempt.  We have established sales tax exempted accounts with common major suppliers {Digikey, Mouser, Amazon}. 
* Purchases can be made with other vendors, but please keep in mind that if we do not already have a sales tax exempt account set-up, the ordering process will take extra time.
